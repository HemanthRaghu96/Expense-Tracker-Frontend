# HR Expense Tracker Frontend

This application enables users to manage their expenses with features like user authentication, allowing sign-up, login, and account management through  a custom system using Node.js and JWT. Users can log expenses by entering details such as amount, category, date, and  description. The app includes predefined categories and supports custom categories. The expense list offers sorting and filtering by date, category, or amount, with an expense summary highlighting total spending by month and category. Users can visualize their spending habits using charts, such as pie charts for category distribution and line charts for monthly expenses, utilizing React with Chart.js . Data is persisted locally with  a database for authenticated users. The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices, supported by Tailwind CSS. Additionally, users can export their expense data as a CSV file using FileSaver.js or a custom function.
